20 Sept 08	Adapting the freepv QTVR reader

Goal:
  use Pablo's QTVRDecoder, with QImage replacing his Image

Files copied from freepv/src:
	Image.h
	JpegReader.h, .cpp
	Parameters.h, .cpp
	QTVRDecoder.h, .cpp

Initial strategy:
  make Image class a wrapper around QImage,
  modify Parameters to fit into Qt framework,
  use QTVRDecoder unchanged.
  replace freepv jpeg decoder with Qt's (use QBuffer as "device")

	
	
1 October 2008  a bug un ubuntu hardy heron?
	When main window is maximized, the UI goes dead.
	This is not the case on Win32 (minGW).
	
2 Oct 2008	Adapting QTVRDecoder 
	It first parses and indexes the QTVR file then extracts 
	all found pano images by rereading sections as jpeg.
	It uses stdio so will only work on a local file.  Should 
	have the ability to work from memory too.
	It would be good to be able to load the cube faces
	separately.
	Repackaging as a QImageIOPlugin would provide a lot of
	nice behavior.  The downside is that it would be a lot of 
	work and the plugin dll has to be installed in a special 
	directory name.  A probably much easier alternative	is to 
	make a readQTVR class that just gets the jpeg files in core, 
	and use a QImageReader on those.  I think this could be done
	without making	the QTVR reader depend on Qt.
  [no it can't, much better to revise QTVRDecoder to use QImage
  and a few other Qt types.  This I have done.]
	But first I'll try to use QTVRDecoder pretty much as-is,
	with a Qt-based Image class, defs from parameters.h or 
	utils.h replaced with local defs. 
 3 Oct:  pvQt_QTVR.{h,cpp} have a Qt-based QTVRDecoder that
    returns QImages, one at a time.  It still uses stdio and
    a C-string file name.  I revised the tile copy logic to
    also do the 90 degree rotation of cylindrical panos -- it
    now uses a single generalized add tile to image routine
    for all cases.
