20 Sept 08	Adapting the freepv QTVR reader

Goal:
  use Pablo's QTVRDecoder, with QImage replacing his Image

Files copied from freepv/src:
	Image.h
	JpegReader.h, .cpp
	Parameters.h, .cpp
	QTVRDecoder.h, .cpp

Initial strategy:
  make Image class a wrapper around QImage,
  modify Parameters to fit into Qt framework,
  use QTVRDecoder unchanged.
  replace freepv jpeg decoder with Qt's (use QBuffer as "device")

	
	
1 October 2008  a bug un ubuntu hardy heron?
	When main window is maximized, the UI goes dead.
	This is not the case on Win32 (minGW).
	
2 Oct 2008	Adapting QTVRDecoder 
	It first parses and indexes the QTVR file then extracts 
	all found pano images by rereading sections as jpeg.
	It uses stdio so will only work on a local file.  Should 
	have the ability to work from memory too.
	It would be good to be able to load the cube faces
	separately.
	Repackaging as a QImageIOPlugin would provide a lot of
	nice behavior.  One downside is that the plugin dll has
	to be installed in a special directory name.  A probably
	much easier alternative	is to make a readQTVR class that 
	just gets the jpeg files in core, and use a QImageReader 
	on those.  I think this could be done without making
	the QTVR reader depend on Qt.
	But first I'll try to use QTVRDecoder pretty much as-is,
	with a Qt-based Image class, defs from parameters.h or 
	utils.h replaced with local defs.
