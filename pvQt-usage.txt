How to use pvQt                                             version 0.1 09 October 2008

The purpose of pvQt is viewing panoramic and wide angle pictures.  It can load all the common panoramic formats, from ordinary image files or QuickTime VR (.mov) files.  Like other viewers, it shows images in normal rectilinear perspective, but can also display extremely wide angle fisheye views, and a range of intermediate perspectives.  

VIEW CONTROLS

When you start pvQt without a command line, for example by double clicking an icon, it displays a wire frame model of the panosphere.  You can use the View commands to see how they change your view of the sphere.  All the view commands have keyboard shortcuts, shown in the View menu.  Zoom in is Control + =, zoom out is Control + -, as in Photoshop.  The arrow keys adjust yaw and pitch; Control + arrrows adjust roll and perspective.  Home takes you back to zero yaw, pitch and roll; End also resets perspective and zoom.  Page up and Page down set both zoom and perspective for useful very wide angle views. 

Zoom controls the vertical field of view on the panosphere.  When you resize the window, the image grows or shrinks to maintain the selected vertical field.  

Perspective adjusts the apparent distance of the viewpoint from the center of the panosphere.  It is reported as "Dist", in units of the sphere's radius.  When Dist is zero, the viewing perspective is rectilinear, like a "normal" camera lens; as it increases, the perspective becomes more "fisheye"-like, and more of the sphere can be seen when you zoom all the way out.  Finally, at Dist = 1.1 radii, you get a circular image that can show almost 288 degrees of the sphere.

Cylindrical and some rectilinear images are displayed on a cylindrical "virtual screen" instead of a spherical one.  The view controls work much the same, with different ranges of adjustment.  The view control ranges are also apropriately limited when images with smaller angular sizes are displayed.

COMMAND LINE and Picture MENU

pvQt accepts a command line consisting of zero or one picture type name, followed by zero or more file names.  The possible picture type names are:
	"proj"	PanoTools script or project
	"qtvr"	QuickTime VR panorama
	"rect"	Normal lens photo
	"fish"	Fisheye lens photo
	"cyli"	Cylindrical panorama
	"equi"	Equirectangular panorama
	"hemi"	1 or 2 Hemispherical images
	"cube"	1 to 6 Cube face images

If you give just a type name, pvQt will pop a file selector dialog so you can choose the file(s) to be displayed.  If you cancel that dialog, and the picture type is not "qtvr" or "proj", pvQt will display an "empty" image consisting of labelled frames (just a "front" frame for most picture types; or six cube faces).  Some day you will be able to load images by dragging them into those frames.

If you give just file names, pvQt will pop a dialog asking you to specify the picture type and angular image size.	 Cancelling this dialog leaves the display as it was.  On windows, dragging one or more files onto the pvQt program icon generates a files-only command line.

The Picture menu selects a picture type, and works just like a type-only command line.

You can specify 1 to 6 image files for the "cube" picture type.  Their sorted names should fall into the conventional cube face order: front, right, back, left, top, bottom; and they must all be square images of the same size.  Emtpy frames will be displayed for any missing files.

The "hemi" picture type accepts one or two images, representing the front and back halves of a spherical panorama; however it remains to be seen whether OpenGL can actually display a full sphere in "sphere map " mode.
