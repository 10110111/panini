pvQt Specifications 	24 Sep 2008 TKSharpless

pvQt is a projective image viewer using OPenGL in the Qt framework.  Although designed to handle spherical panoramic images, it can display images of any angular size.  It shows the image projected on a flat or curved virtual screen, in a perspective view that can be rotated and zoomed freely without changing the point of view.  The user can pick 3D virtual screen points with the mouse.

The default virtual screen is a sphere, that can hold a full spherical panorama.  It is normally seen from within, either from the center (spherical view) or from a point on its surface (pseudo-stereographic view).  A flat rectangular screen is also available.  Eventually I'd like to provide spherical, toroidal and ellipsoidal screen surfaces with a continuous range of curvatures, both positive and negative.

You can also control the viewing perspective by selecting various source and texture mapping projections, and by moving the eye point within a limited 3D range.

The main components of pvQt are pvQtView, a QGLWidget subclass that displays pictures; class pvQtPic, which holds picture specifications and source data; and a QImageIO plugin for reading QTVR images from Quicktime movie (.mov) files.

Being a QPaintDevice, pvQtView can show 2D graphics generated by an external QPainter, and provides a signal for activating possible overlay painting after each OpenGL frame is rendered.  There is also some support for drawing 3D graphics on the virtual screen.  A signal emitted at each mouse event provides the corresponding virtual screen point.  

pvQtPic can be used to "drive" the display programmatically, and is subclassed to provide other ways of acquiring the specifications and image data, such as interacting with a user or downloading from a website.  The main interactive subclass, pvQtPicGUI, has dialogs for choosing files and setting specifications, but can also accept files via drag-and-drop and handle many common cases automatically.

pvQt handles these common photographic and panoramic projections:  rectilinear, fisheye, hemispherical, cylindrical, equirectangular, and cubic.  pvQtPic can load images from files in any format supported by QImageReader, and from memory images of most file types.  It also accepts QImages and has a simple generic interface for other memory resident images.
